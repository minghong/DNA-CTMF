# DNA-CTMF

The codes are located in the **code** folder, lena.bmp and Lisa.bmp are examples.

Run **gray_image.py** to simulate grayscale image (lena.bmp) in DNA storage with different error rates and compositions. 

Run **color_image.py** to simulate color image (Lisa.bmp) in DNA storage with different error rates and compositions.

**gray_image_quality_index.py** and **color_image_quality_index.py** are codes that calculate the indexes of reconstructed image. **color_image_quality_index.py**  provide two ways to calculate MSE, PSNR, SSIM in color images.
